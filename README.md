# LangSwarm-Synapse

LangSwarm-Synapse is a framework designed for multi-agent LLM ecosystems. It enables seamless orchestration of AI agents through workflows such as consensus-building, voting, branching, and aggregation, making it an ideal choice for developers looking to enhance AI collaboration and decision-making.

## Features

- **Consensus**: Reach agreement among multiple LLMs for a given query.
- **Voting**: Facilitate collaborative decision-making by tallying responses.
- **Branching**: Generate diverse outputs from multiple agents.
- **Aggregation**: Merge and unify responses into a coherent output.
- **Routing**: Dynamically direct tasks to the most appropriate workflows or agents.

## Installation

```bash
pip install langswarm-synapse
```

## Quick Start

Hereâ€™s how you can use LangSwarm-Synapse to enable consensus among agents:

```python
from langswarm.synapse.interface import Templates

agents = [agent1, agent2, agent3]  # List of initialized LLM agents
query = "What are the benefits of renewable energy?"

# Use the consensus workflow
result = Templates.consensus(agents, query)
print(result)
```

## Workflows

### 1. Consensus
Enable agreement among agents using shared similarity measures and thresholds.

### 2. Voting
Aggregate responses and determine consensus through voting-based decision-making.

### 3. Branching
Generate diverse outputs from multiple agents to explore varied perspectives.

### 4. Aggregation
Merge responses into a single, deduplicated, and unified result.

### 5. Routing
Dynamically assign tasks to workflows or agents based on predefined logic.

## Development

### Requirements
