# **LLMBranching**

## **Overview**

The **LLMBranching** class in LangSwarm enables multi-agent workflows by generating diverse outputs from multiple agents. It is ideal for scenarios where varied perspectives, creative brainstorming, or exploration of multiple solutions is required.

---

## **Key Features**

1. **Diverse Output Generation**:  
   Simultaneously query multiple agents to generate a variety of responses to a single query.

2. **Parallel Exploration**:  
   Each agent explores the query independently, ensuring diverse and creative outputs.

3. **Flexible Integration**:  
   Compatible with agents from LangChain, Hugging Face, OpenAI, or custom implementations via the `AgentWrapper`.

4. **LangChain-Compatible**:  
   Can be seamlessly integrated into LangChain workflows.

## **API Reference**

### **Class: `LLMBranching`**

Generates diverse responses from multiple agents.

#### **Initialization**

```python
LLMBranching(query, clients, verbose=False)
```

| Parameter  | Type    | Description                                                                |
|------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `query`    | `str`   | The input query to be processed by the agents.                             |
| `clients`  | `list`  | A list of agents participating in the branching process.                   |
| `verbose`  | `bool`  | If `True`, enables detailed logging. Default is `False`.                   |

---

### **Methods**

#### **`run()`**

Executes the branching workflow, querying all agents and returning their responses.

**Returns**:  
- `list`: A list of responses from all participating agents.

---

## **Examples**

### **Basic Example**

```python
from langswarm.swarm import LLMBranching
from langswarm.wrappers import AgentWrapper
from langchain.llms import OpenAI

# Step 1: Create and wrap agents
agent1 = AgentWrapper(agent=OpenAI(model="gpt-4"), is_conversational=True)
agent2 = AgentWrapper(agent=OpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo"), is_conversational=True)

# Step 2: Initialize LLMBranching with the agents
query = "Propose innovative solutions for reducing carbon emissions."
branching_swarm = LLMBranching(query=query, clients=[agent1, agent2])

# Step 3: Run the branching workflow
responses = branching_swarm.run()

# Display the results
for i, response in enumerate(responses):
    print(f"Agent {i + 1} Response:", response)
```

---

### **Advanced Example: Combining Branching with Analysis**

```python
from langswarm.swarm import LLMBranching
from langswarm.wrappers import AgentWrapper
from transformers import pipeline

# Step 1: Create and wrap agents
huggingface_agent = AgentWrapper(agent=pipeline("text-generation", model="gpt2"), is_conversational=False)

openai_agent = AgentWrapper(agent="openai_gpt3", is_conversational=True)  # Assuming an OpenAI agent wrapper

# Step 2: Initialize LLMBranching
query = "List creative ways to promote renewable energy adoption."
branching_swarm = LLMBranching(query=query, clients=[huggingface_agent, openai_agent])

# Step 3: Run the branching workflow
responses = branching_swarm.run()

# Step 4: Analyze the responses
print("Collected Responses:")
for i, response in enumerate(responses):
    print(f"Agent {i + 1}:", response)
```

## **How It Works**

1. **Querying Agents**:  
   All agents in the `clients` list are queried with the provided input.

2. **Independent Exploration**:  
   Each agent generates a response independently, ensuring diverse outputs.

3. **Returning Results**:  
   All responses are returned as a list for further processing or analysis.

---

## **Best Practices**

1. **Diverse Agents**:  
   Use a mix of agents to ensure varied perspectives and creative solutions.

2. **Enable Verbose Mode**:  
   Use `verbose=True` during development to understand the branching process.

3. **Combine with Other Tools**:  
   Use branching in conjunction with tools like voting or aggregation for enhanced workflows.

---

## **Use Cases**

1. **Creative Brainstorming**:  
   Generate a variety of ideas or solutions for creative tasks.

2. **Scenario Exploration**:  
   Explore different perspectives or approaches to a given problem.

3. **Diverse Output Generation**:  
   Produce multiple versions of an answer for comparison or refinement.

---

## **Key Advantages**

- **Enhanced Creativity**:  
  Allows agents to explore queries independently, fostering creative and diverse outputs.

- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**:  
  Leverages the strengths of multiple agents for broader exploration.

- **Flexible Integration**:  
  Easily integrates into existing LangChain workflows or standalone applications.

---

## **Future Enhancements**

1. **Dynamic Agent Selection**:  
   Automatically select agents based on query type or content.

2. **Weighted Branching**:  
   Assign weights to agents based on their reliability or relevance to the query.

3. **Post-Branching Analysis**:  
   Include built-in tools to analyze and rank responses.

---

The **LLMBranching** class is a powerful tool for generating diverse outputs from multiple agents. Whether for brainstorming, scenario exploration, or creative workflows, LangSwarmâ€™s branching capabilities ensure a variety of high-quality responses for further analysis or refinement.
