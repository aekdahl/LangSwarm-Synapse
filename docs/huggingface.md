# Next Steps
Expand Supported Tasks: Add specific handling for tasks like summarization or translation.
Fine-Tuning Support: Integrate methods for fine-tuning Hugging Face models directly in LangSwarm.
Performance Optimization: Implement caching and efficient batch processing for Hugging Face models.
Dynamic Model Loading: Allow models to be loaded dynamically based on user preferences or workflow requirements.

# Additional Features to Consider
Caching Models Locally: Use cache_dir when loading models to reduce network overhead.
Automatic Model Selection: Provide default models for common tasks (e.g., "text-classification").
Fine-Tuning Integration: Add methods to fine-tune Hugging Face models within the wrapper.
Dynamic Task Selection: Allow users to change tasks dynamically (e.g., switching from classification to summarization).
