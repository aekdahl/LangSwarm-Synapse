Extend Consensus Mechanisms
Weighted Voting:

Introduce voting systems where agents have weighted inputs based on reliability, expertise, or past performance.
Rank Aggregation:

Allow agents to provide ranked lists of outputs and implement rank aggregation algorithms (e.g., Borda count, Condorcet methods) to determine consensus.
Crowdsourced Voting:

Enable the integration of human feedback (e.g., via APIs or UI) to enhance or guide consensus-building in ambiguous scenarios.
Hierarchical Consensus:

Build multi-layer consensus workflows where different agent groups provide independent opinions that are consolidated at a higher level.
