Advanced Customization Options
Custom Similarity Metrics:

Allow developers to define custom similarity metrics beyond cosine similarity, such as Jaccard similarity or BLEU scores, for specific use cases.
Modular Thresholding:

Provide options for dynamic, user-configurable thresholds for tasks like paraphrase detection, consensus, and aggregation.
Custom Workflow Definitions:

Enable developers to script custom workflows that chain together LangSwarm modules (e.g., aggregation followed by voting and then consensus).
Extensibility Hooks:

Add pre- and post-processing hooks to inject custom logic before and after workflows, enabling deep customization.
