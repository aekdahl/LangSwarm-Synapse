Support for Real-Time Feedback
Interactive Agent Feedback:

Introduce mechanisms where agents can dynamically revise their outputs based on real-time feedback from other agents or external evaluators.
Create a "feedback loop" system where consensus or voting can trigger re-evaluation by specific agents.
Human-in-the-Loop Support:

Allow optional human intervention during critical stages, such as refining ambiguous outputs or validating consensus decisions.
Adaptive Prompting:

Enable agents to adapt their prompts or behavior dynamically in response to feedback, improving iterative refinement capabilities.
