# Memory
### Key Benefits:
- Context-aware multi-agent interactions using LangChain memory.
- Enhanced continuity for conversational tasks across multiple queries.

---
# Adapters for LangChain Pipelines
LangChain pipelines allow chaining multiple tasks. LangSwarm modules can be integrated as steps in these pipelines, enabling workflows like:

- Preprocessing with LangChain tools.
- Running LangSwarm’s consensus or aggregation modules.
- Postprocessing using LangChain’s prompt templates or retrievers.

### Key Benefits:
Full compatibility with LangChain pipelines.
Combines LangSwarm’s strengths (e.g., consensus, aggregation) with LangChain’s pre- and post-processing capabilities.
